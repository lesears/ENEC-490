%monte carlo

% why not use the monthly stats function -- if yours doesn't work, download mine
d = annual_profile(data);

% remeber, this needs to act on a 12 x N matrix that you've created using 'annual_profile'
stats = monthly_stats(d);
sim_years = 10;

% you want this to be a vector
demand = zeros(sim_years*12,1);

for year = 1:sim_years
    for month = 1:12
        
        % fill in the blanks
        demand((year-1)*12+month) = stats(month,1) + stats(month,2)*randn(1);
        
    end
end


figure
plot(demand)

%both bootstrap and monte carlo show similar results due to constant weather patterns correlated with different amounts of demands.
